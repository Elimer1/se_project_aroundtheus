# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at Tripleten.This project was created with NTML and CSS based on a design on Figma and can adjust to different screen sizes.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5

## Plan on improving the project

Id like to improve on this project by making the card along with description verticle on smaller screens. Id also lie to center the profiel on top and move the add button underneath the profile for all views.
